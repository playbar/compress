Things that could be improved: 
- Pushing 0->100% progress callback form the ue wrapper into 7zpp lib. Adjusting code so that it will work with SetCompleted (this function works a bit inconsistently, so I'm doing progress per file for now which is acceptable).

Wishlist:
- Is it possible to do threading in the library, or do we need a .dll?
- Move away form .dll into cross platform support
- Create ability to uncompress parts of items into memory
- Create ability to compress memory into archive files
- Cmake support?
